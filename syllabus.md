## Course Objectives
After successful completion of the course a student should be able to:

* Application/Use: Use command-line interface to do basic system operations
  such as create a directory, modify file permissions, create a link, manage
  processes, and access a computer remotely.
* Mechanism/Manipulate: Manipulate basic features of a command-line
  environment such as the 'PATH', which specifies the locations of
  executable programs, and the 'CLASSPATH', which specifies the
  locations of Java classes.
* Synthesis/Write: Write basic meta-programs in a shell or scripting language,
  e.g. to compile statistics for numbers stored in text files.
* Application/Use: Use build-system utilities such as 'make'/'cmake',
  'gdb', or 'SCons' to edit, compile, test, time, debug, and profile a
  C program.
* Synthesis/Construct: Construct programs that access data by using the
  range of pointer operations and manual dynamic memory management to
  implement basic ordered binary trees a.k.a. binary search trees (BSTs).

## Grade Breakdown

** Note:  independent of your grade, in order to pass the course you must accomplish all of the following:**
* average at least 45% on the two C projects
* average at least 45% on the two Linux projects
* average at least 40% on the exams



## Extra Credit
There will be two opportunities for extra credit.  

* Extra credit will be awarded for good questions (as marked by the
  instructor) and good answers (as endorsed by the instructor) on Piazza.
  The exact formula is not yet determined, but the extra credit will
  be capped at 1% of the overall course grade.
* In this course we'll use a system called
  [ClassTranscribe](https://classtranscribe.com/offering/2eda65cf-d00f-4a0b-bb00-7bba2f88ccc6)
  for lecture videos that allows students to caption videos.
  The goal of this is to:

  1. Provide accessibility for those who may benefit from accurate captions.
  2. Allow students who miss lectures to catch up with the ability to see
     the missed content in multiple forms (full transcription, video)
  3. Encourage those that utilize the videos to actively watching the lectures
     and focus more.
  4. Provide easy searching of video lectures, making it simple to go back
     and rewatch relevant sections when studying, completing projects, or
     taking exams.

  In order to encourage this, extra credit will be awarded to students
  based on contributions to the captioning of the videos.  The
  exact formula is not yet determined, but the extra credit will
  be capped at 1% of the overall course grade.  In the past, 80 edits (each
  edit can be a simple as correcting a typo, capitalization, or even
  punctuation) was sufficient for earning the full 1%.

## Course Policies
This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
[http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/).

### General Course Policies
* Assignments and minilabs requiring submission will be submitted through
  [PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/129841) and, in
  some cases, also through Github.  More details will be
  provided with the first assignment, but you will need to create a github
  account.  Most minilabs will be awarded credit based attendance on the day
  of the minilab.
* All code submitted should be properly commented.
* Projects are accepted up to 24 hours late for 75% credit.  Projects turned in
  more than 24 hours after the deadline will generally not be accepted,
  except in extenuating circumstances (e.g. severe illness, etc.).
  Any work done on an assignment
  after more than 24 hours after the deadline will not be counted for credit.
* If health issues for you or someone you care for, longer term internet issues,
  childcare issues, etc. arise, please post
  a private Piazza note to the me ASAP so we can work together to
  identify a solution.
* There may be a need for changes to happen midsemester, so this
  information is tentative and the
  instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course
  calendar, due dates, number of assignments, office hour times and modality,
  etc.

### PrairieLearn Policies
PrairieLearn (PL) will be used for coding projects, some minilabs, and exams.
PL is an online system that will allow you to submit code for
autograding.  You will be able to submit, see your grade, and resubmit
prior to the due date/time to improve your grade without penalty as
many times as you wish.  Except in cases of academic integrity violations or
attempts to fool the autograder,
in which case your score may be lowered after the fact,
your score for autograded problems will be the score on PrairieLearn (unless you
submit after the deadline, in which case your score for the project will not change).
If you submit code that does not run or compile,
you will receive a 0.  Any partial credit will be awarded by the autograder; no
additional partial credit will be awarded.  For projects, there
may be a manually graded portion as well -- these points will be
awarded manually.  

The goal of using PL is to, as a whole, improve grades by
allowing you to assess your solution and continue to refine it.
For coding problems, there are often both visible test cases and hidden
test cases.  For many problems, the hidden test cases are edge cases
that may not be something that was considered when you first developed
your approach to the problem.  The goal of the autograder is to

1. Let you see when your solution is correct
2. Help you become a better programmer by forcing you to think
   carefully about what scenarios may arise.

While the autograders have been tested, it is possible that
there are bugs.  If you believe there is an issue
with the autograder, please post a private note on Piazza ASAP.

### Minilab Policies
During some class periods, short activities will be given to provide
you with a chance to apply the concepts discussed in the lectures.  The goal
of these is for you to be able to practice in an environment where help is
readily available and prevent students from falling behind.  These minilabs will
sometimes encompass the entire class period, but other times will be the latter
half of a class period.

In most cases, attendance during the minilab portion will be the default
way of awarding credit (attendance is expected).  
If you miss a class with a minilab, you will need to reach out to me to
arrange a separate way of showing completion.
In some cases, minilabs may be submitted on PL (if this
is the case it will be clearly stated on the schedule).  Additionally,
for some minilabs, I may ask a couple students to walkthrough their
attempt with the class.

Two minilabs will be dropped -- think of this like a free
skip day, no need to even say anything.  

### Exam Policies
Exams will be taken on PrairieLearn and consist of both
non-coding (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.) questions
and one or more coding questions. Exams will be split over multiple
class periods to allow sufficient time for coding.

### Quiz Policy
There will be one oral quiz (very short, 10 minutes max).
The purpose of this quiz is for you to demonstrate proficiency in
basic command line navigation.  This quiz will be graded credit/no-credit.
To pass, you must demonstrate fluency on the command line.  If you fail, you
will have 1 opportunity to retake the quiz (which will also be graded
credit/no-credit).

### Academic Honesty Policies
All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards
set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students
in this course are expected to adhere to the [academic honesty
guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm). Fundamentally,
the work you submit must be your own.  When in doubt, ask the instructor
first and cite any resources.

For this course:
* **Mini-labs**:  you are welcome to collaborate with classmates
  on the mini-labs as these are designed
  solely as a checkpoint for you to apply the material.
* **Projects**:  should be completed individually.  This means that
  each student will turn in their own solution for the project, and that
  solution must be their own work.  You are more than welcome to discuss
  your approach with other students and bouncing ideas off of one another
  and discussing issues is encouraged, but you should not be sharing your
  code, working on code together, etc.
  You are not allowed to copy code from online (even if you change
  parts of the code).  You are also not allowed to use or benefit from any full
  solutions to problems (or solutions to a large component of a problem) 
  that you may find online.
  Fundamentally, the work you turn in must be your own.
* **Exams**:  Exams are to be completed individually.  Exams are open-book,
  open-note.  You are free to consult your project solutions,
  examples used in class, and lecture notes while taking your exams.
  **You cannot, however, discuss or share any portion of the exam with another
  individual (whether or not they are taking this class)**.  You are also
  not allowed to benefit from any other student that may have sought outside help.
  Using any unauthorized resource will be considered an academic integrity
  violation and may result in disciplinary
  action up to failure in the course.
* **Quiz**:  The quiz will be completed individually.

#### FAQs:
* Can I use ChatGPT, Google Co-pilot, or similar technologies? *No, the work you
  submit must be your own and all code should be written by you, so this would
  be considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I seek help through sites like upwork? *No, this would generally be
  considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I have help from a tutor?  *You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
  you submit for projects in the end must be your own.  You may not consult
  tutors when taking exams.*
* Can I use sites like stackoverflow?  *Yes, this is allowed in this course,
  so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
  for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
  portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).*
* Can I use sites like Chegg?  *No, this would be considered an academic
  integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question*
* Can I use general online resources?  *That depends.
  Fundamentally, the work you turn in must
  be your own.  This means that heavily basing your solution on (or directly copying)
  code for a significant component of a problem is not allowed.  Talk to me first.*

#### Regret Policy
I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after.  In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy".  Within 48 hours of
the due date (or late deadline if working on it late)
for a project or within 48 hours of completing an exam, you can
withdraw your submission if after contemplation you believe you may have committed
academic misconduct.  To do so, you must inform me in via email or private Piazza
note within 48 hours of the due date / late deadline including the following text:
> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause
1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened.  Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
   invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date / late
deadline / exam completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

## Equity and Inclusion
As an instructor, I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning
environment in our class.  Please reach out to me if there is any behavior in
the classroom that makes you feel unwelcome in any way.  To the extent permitted
by law, I will keep this information confidential.

## Special Assistance
If there is any student in this class who has special
needs because of learning, physical or other disability,
please contact me and Disability Support Resources (DSR)
at 616.331.2490.
