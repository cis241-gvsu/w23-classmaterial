# Piazza FAQ

## What is Piazza?

An online Q&A forum designed specifically for teaching

## Why are we using it?

1. get faster responses - get responses from both the instructor and students
2. lets students benefit from others' questions - classmates
   may ask something you never even thought to ask
3. removes barriers for students who may be shy or hesitant
   to actively participate 
4. provides a single, organized place for all course
   communication -- they are searchable, filterable, starrable, and persist
   throughout the semester and after it is over
5. ensures all questions get answered satisfactorily -- unanswered
   and unresolved questions are clearly marked which prevents issues with emails
   getting lost or forgotten
6. allows easy code and math formatting in questions and answers

## Do I have to use it?

Yes, Piazza is required.  Important announcements will be posted
on Piazza and it is your responsibility to monitor Piazza for these
announcements.  If you have a question/concern, please post on Piazza
rather than emailing the professor to ensure you receive the fastest response.
To make sure all students benefit equally, questions in emails may be
redirected to be posted to Piazza.

## How does it work?

* *Creating a post:*  Simply press "New Post" in the upper left,
   choose "question" if you want a response or "note" if no response needed
   (like posting a link to a resource you found helpful).
   Fill in the question title ("Summary") and full question text, and post!
* *Answering questions:* Select a question and edit or add the "Students" answer.
* *Followups:* If a question is closely related, or you or another student want further
   clarification, post a followup below the question which can be answered with replies.
* *Email frequency:* In your settings, you can change how frequently you receive emails
   with the exception of some important instructor announcements which will spam out emails
   regardless of settings.

## Should I post my question publicly?

Yes -- in almost all cases.  Even if you don't think another student
has the same question, please post publicly unless:

1. it is about you specifically (illness, grades, etc)
2. it is **absolutely necessary** to post large chunks of
   code or solutions in order to ask your question (basically
   don't give away the answer in a public post). 

If you are more comfortable,
you always have the opportunity to post your question anonymously to
your classmates.  

## What makes a good question?

A good question is one that clearly describes the issue
(what the problem is or what you don't understand), what you have tried so far,
and what you are currently thinking.  Without knowing what a student is
thinking, it's hard to identify what they are misunderstanding.  It's hard to help
students learn with questions like "How do I do X?".  By describing what you've
tried, what your thinking and what your approach is (even if your current approach
isn't along the right track) I can identify where
the misunderstanding is and tailor my answer.

## Will you help me debug code via Piazza?

That depends -- while Piazza is a fantastic resource, it is not always the best
venue for helping students debug code and is not a complete substitute for
office hours.  For instance, simply posting all of your code and asking
what is wrong will likely be redirected to virtual office hours to walk
through it together in a more back and forth conversation.

On the other hand, Piazza can be great for going
through and potentially correcting the general approach of a coded
solution that you can describe in words.  It is also very appropriate
if you can isolate the issue down to a few lines of code not behaving
as anticipated.
