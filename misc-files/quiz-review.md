## Basic Command Line Quiz Review Guide

The point of this quiz is to make sure that you are:
1. Comfortable navigating the command line
2. Understand the basic ideas that are necessary to
   understand how to navigate the command line.

You should be able to do the following tasks at the command line
* Navigate into and out of different directories
* Remove a file
* Remove a directory
* Understand the difference between relative and absolute paths
  * Describe the difference
  * Use a relative path when prompted (for instance, "remove this file with a relative path"
    or "create a file in a certain location by specifying an absolute path")
  * Know what `/`, `..`, and `~` do in the context of paths
* Make a new (simple file) with vim (I won't expect you to do the
  editing covered in the vim lecture, just simple create a file, type some stuff, save and exit).
* make a new directory
* view the files in a specified directory
* copy a file
* copy a directory
* rename or move a file
* rename or move a directory
* figure out where you currently are in the filesystem
* show the different ways you can find out more about a command and its options (aka manpages and help options)
* view the contents of a file -- know the different commands and when to use which.
  For instance, you could be asked to run a command to:
  * view the entire contents of a small file
  * view the start or end of a file
  * look at a very large file
* run a command and send the output to a file
* run a comamnd sending a file in as stdin
* remotely access another machine with `ssh`
* transfer a file to or from another machine with `scp`
