### Linux Filesystem

* Hierarchical filesystem
* root directory /
* other directories branch off from root (home, tmp, etc, ...)
* home directory for each user ~
* absolute paths from / or expanded by ~
* relative from current directory

---

### Navigating the filesystem

* `mkdir` - make a directory
* `cd` - change into a different directory
* `ls` - list files
* `rm` - remove
* `cp` - copy - careful
* `mv` - move/rename - careful
* `pwd` - print working directory

---

## Command Options

* Most commands have options
    * Modifies effect of command
    * Example `ls -al`
        * Equivalent to `ls -a -l`
        * `-a` and `-l` are options
* How do we know available options?
* Most have a `--help` option too
