### More (than you ever wanted to know) on compiling

* `-o` option - specify output file
* `-O` option - specify optimization level when compiling
    * compiling goes to machine code
    * some machine code is faster/uses less space than others
    * optimization level makes optimization for these tradeoffs
    * CAREFUL -> high optimization levels can break code!
* `-Wall` - enables warning messages
