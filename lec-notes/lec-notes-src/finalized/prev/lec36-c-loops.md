### Simple Arrays

* Arrays have a type
* For now, we'll only have statically sized arrays
* Examples:
    * `int arr[10];`
    * `int arr[3] = {2, 4, 6};`
    * `char arr[5];`
    * `char arr[] = "hello";`

### Control Structures - For Loop

* Example
```
for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
    \\ do something cool here
}
```
* Depending on version of C, may be able to create loop variable in initialization

### Control Structures - While Loop

```
while (expression) {
    statement;
}
```
