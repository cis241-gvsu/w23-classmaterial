## Minilab 13

The purpose of this minilab is to incentive you to do the 
[practice quiz](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/129841/assessment/2334470).
As long as you make some attempt where you actually try the partial credit
on it you'll get credit for this minilab --
your score doesn't matter.  The whole purpose is to make sure people actually
try the system out before the midterm.
