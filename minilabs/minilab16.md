# Minilab 16

The point of this minilab is to better understand
how pointers work and what we mean when we say C is
pass-by-value.

Create a function called `swap` that swaps the value of
two integers.  It should work in-place, actually modifying
the integers.  It should return void.  You'll likely
have to think through how you can accomplish this
and likely need to try a few different ways.
